= The Expert System

expert system:: a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.

In the late '70s, the Digital Equipment Corporation had a problem.
Their newest instruction architecture, the VAX, was becoming incredibly popular.

But their catalogue of computer parts had become so long that they needed an expert just to figure out what components they'd need to put together to fit their requirements.

To illustrate this, on the right is a mainframe for a VAX 11/780.
All the different hardware parts are stored and connected in these cabinets -- and this is for just a single computer.

Considering that an expert was needed to fit together one of these computers, it isn't all that surprising that DEC had difficulties training their salespeople to sell them.
Hours would be wasted on consultations, and millions of dollars on replacement parts for misconfigured sales.

DEC hired an associate professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University called John McDermott.
His task?
Create a system that will automate this process.

== Bashing Your Head at a Problem

A common problem-solving technique in computer science is that of brute force.
Need to get through a door?
Just bash it down.

McDermott didn't really do anything too creative.
In fact, he did something very simple -- he asked the experts.

Of course, it wasn't always a simple task, especially when experts disagreed over ideal configurations; but McDermott pressed through and eventually made the link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcon++[R1 Expert System].

The R1 was a monstrosity with over 2500 rules, but it worked -- and it would eventually save DEC millions of dollars.
